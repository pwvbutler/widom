    """Run the Widom insertion algorithm to calculate interaction energies.

    This function performs Widom insertion of gas molecules into a structure to calculate
    interaction energies, which can be used for computing the Henry coefficient and heat
    of adsorption.

    Args:
        calculator: Calculator object from ASE to calculate energies.
        structure: Atoms object representing the framework structure.
        gas: Atoms object representing the gas molecule to insert.
        num_insertions: Number of random insertions to perform.
        cutoff_distance: Minimum allowed distance between framework atoms and gas molecule, in angstroms.
        cutoff_to_com: Whether to use the center of mass for distance calculations.
        min_interplanar_distance: Minimum interplanar distance before constructing a supercell, in angstroms.
        random_seed: Seed for random number generator to ensure reproducibility.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - Array of total energies (in eV) for each insertion attempt.
            - Array of booleans indicating whether the insertion was successful (non-overlapping with framework atoms).
            - Array of positions of the inserted gas molecules.
